# POMODOING - Quite possibly a useless venture

You have seen all the pomodoro apps out there. You have one for your phone. Your PC. Your mac. And quite possibly, a physical one for the bathroom as well.

My pomodoro app presents nothing new. Just take it as I wanted to build my own simple and clean looking pomodoro app for windows, 
and I wanted to play with XAML a bit so I decided to build Pomodoing. 

I also wanted to build something open source and release it and hope that it will be useful for people out there. Even though this app doesn not bring anything new to the table it is still being made really clean and I want to keep it that way because none of the other apps out there really made me feel happy to use it. 
That is what I want this app to be. Something that makes people happy in being productive.
